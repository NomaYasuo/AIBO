Betty Botter bought some butter,
But, she said, the butter's bitter;
If I put it in my batter,
That will make my batter bitter.
But a bit of better butter, 
That will make my batter better.
So she bought a bit of butter
Better than her bitter butter.
And she put it in her batter,
And it made her batter better.
So it was better Betty Botter
Bought a bit of better butter.
